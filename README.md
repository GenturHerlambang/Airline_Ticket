# Airline Ticket Price Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the price of airline tickets using machine learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook h8dsft_Milestone2P1_Gentur_Herlambang.ipynb contains the detailed steps taken to explore, preprocess, model, and evaluate the airline ticket price dataset.


# Introduction
Predicting airline ticket prices accurately is a valuable tool for both customers and airlines. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of airline tickets based on various factors such as flight duration, departure and arrival times, airline carriers, and more. By accurately predicting ticket prices, customers can make informed decisions, and airlines can optimize pricing strategies.

# Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is available at Airline Ticket Price Dataset. It contains information about airline tickets, including features like flight duration, departure and arrival times, number of stops, airline carriers, and the corresponding ticket prices.

# Key Steps
The project involves the following key steps:

- Data Exploration: Perform an initial exploration of the airline ticket price dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution of ticket prices.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing features that may improve the prediction performance of the model.
- Model Building: Build a machine learning model, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, or random forest regression, to predict ticket prices based on the selected features.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.
- Prediction and Insights: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data and analyze the results to gain insights into the factors that influence airline ticket prices.
